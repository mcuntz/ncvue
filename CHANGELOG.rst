Changelog
=========

All notable changes after its initial development up to November 2020 (v1.0)
are documented in this file.

v3.5 (Jun 2021)
-----------------
* Uses different themes on different operating systems.
* New add_cyclic function used as submitted to Cartopy.

v3.4 (May 2021)
-----------------
* Works in ipython and jupyter notebooks. Adapted documentation accordingly.
* Added license to documentation.
* Change separator character to unit separator (ASCII 31).
* Print correct coordinates and values on plotting window.
* Set time axis to numpy's datetime64 format.
* Moved from Matplotlib style seaborn-darkgrid to seaborn-dark.
* Grid is drawn by hand in contour plot. Set automatic grid to
  False: `self.axes.grid(False)`.

v3.3.1 (Feb 2021)
-----------------
* Better installation instructions for all platforms.
* Dropped claim of Python 2 support, which was not given.

v3.3 (Feb 2021)
---------------
* Main window disappears if closed even if called from within Python.
* Added Windows Installer for ncvue standalone program.
* Added standalone app for macOS.

v3.2 (Jan 2021)
---------------
* Added 'Open File' button to switch between files.
* Separated Tk() and Toplevel() to communicate via Tk() between windows.
* Externalise analysis of netcdf file for open file button.
* Allow finding images path in standalone applications using pyinstaller.

v3.1 (Jan 2021)
---------------
* Include ncvue/images/*.png in PyPI wheel.

v3.0 (Jan 2021)
---------------
* Moved from ReadTheDocs to Github Pages for documentation.
* Added tooltips to all selectors, entries, menus.
* Variable names are now separated by SEPCHAR=chr(6) because netcdf
  variable names can have spaces, parentheses, brackets, etc.
* Map panel is only chosen first if either lon or lat have more than one
  grid cell.
* Central longitude is now calculated in 0-360 range but set in -180 to 180
  range. Seems to be more stable for grids that are missing for example the
  southern hemisphere.
* Catch a few errors if variable is for example a simple string (e.g.
  vegetation type, basin name or similar).

v2.0 (Jan 2021)
---------------
* Added Map panel.
* Assure 2-digit month and day and 4 digit year in time unit.
* Added return on numeric keyboard to key bindings.
* Changed layout so that dimensions are below variable selection
  spinboxes.
* Transpose array by default in Contour panel so that first dimension
  (time) is on x-axis (col) because contourf/pcolormesh use (row,col).
* Common arithmetic operations on axes: mean, std, min, max, ptp, sum,
  median, var.
* General get_slice function for x, y, y2, and z.
* Only activate valid dimensions for chosen variable, disable others.
* Axis labels are now the long_name attribute then the standard_name
  attribute and only if both are missing the variable name.

v1.4 (Dec 2020)
---------------
* Colorbar menu with images of colorbars. 
* Use unlimited dimension instead of first dimension in Scatter and Contour
  panels as default for 'all'.
* Use slice function rather than numpy.take to extract slices of arrays,
  i.e. reads only the current slice from disk.
* Enhanced documentation with automatic API generation.

v1.3 (Dec 2020)
---------------
* Use zmin/zmax to fix colorbar for different dimensions in Contour panel.
* Optional grid lines in Contour panel.
* Possibility to invert x-axis in Scatter/Line panel.
* Rename Scatter to Scatter/Line.
* Use build instead of cibuildwheel to make pure Python wheels.

v1.2 (Dec 2020)
---------------
* Put common methods in ncvmethods (first arg is self).
* Make lists of labels, spinboxes and values of dimensions
  rather than exhaustive lists of if/elif statements.

v1.1 (Dec 2020)
---------------
* Modularised ncvue to have utilities and different panels in individual
  files.
* Open new window without helper class ncvWin to avoid circular import
  when modularised.

v1.0 (Nov 2020)
---------------
* Initial release on Github.
* Scatter and Contour plot panels.
