## About ncvue

*ncvue* is a minimal GUI for a quick view of netCDF files. It is aiming to be a
drop-in replacement for ncview, being slightly more general than
[ncview](http://meteora.ucsd.edu/~pierce/ncview_home_page.html), which targets
maps.

*ncvue* is a Python script that can be called from the Python and as a command
line tool.


## Documentation

The complete documentation for *ncvue* is available from Read The Docs.

   http://ncvue.readthedocs.org/en/latest/


## Quick usage guide

Try it on the command line as:

```bash
    ncvue netcdf_file.nc
```

or from within Python:

```python
    from ncvue import ncvue
    ncvue('netcdf_file.nc')
```

Note that *ncvue* uses the `TkAgg` backend of `matplotlib`. It must be called
before any other call to `matplotlib`. This means also that you cannot launch it
in `iPython` that was called with `--pylab`. But it can be called in normal
`iPython`.


## Installation

The easiest way to install is via `pip`:

```bash
    pip install ncvue
```
	
See the [installation instructions](http://ncvue.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)
in the [documentation](http://ncvue.readthedocs.io) for more information.


## Requirements:

- [NumPy](https://www.numpy.org)
- [netcdf4](https://unidata.github.io/netcdf4-python/netCDF4/index.html)
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

*ncvue* uses the "themed Tk" ("ttk") functionality of Tk 8.5. It hence needs Python 2.7 or Python 3.1 or later. Linux users might need to update their (very old) Tk installations.
